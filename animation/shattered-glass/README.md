# Shattered Glass

Opening reassembles an irregular fracture map. Closing breaks the window into 41 unequal polygonal shards, with clustered small splinters, large fragments, independent release delays, tumbling, launch velocities, and gravity.

## Use

Save [effect.toml](effect.toml) and [shader.glsl](shader.glsl) together in `~/.config/umbriel/shaders/community/animation/shattered-glass/`, keeping the [MIT license](../../LICENSES/Barrulus-MIT.txt). Merge [config.toml](config.toml) into your Umbriel configuration:

```toml
[include]
files = ["shaders/community/animation/shattered-glass/effect.toml"]

[animation]
enabled = true

[animation.windows_in]
enabled = true
effect = "shattered-glass"
duration_ms = 900
curve = "linear"

[animation.windows_out]
enabled = true
effect = "shattered-glass"
duration_ms = 800
curve = "linear"
```

Append the include path to an existing `files` array and merge existing tables; do not duplicate them. Including the preset registers it; the two selectors activate the opening/closing pair. Animation selection is global per event.

## Configuration options

Edit the existing `[effects.preset."shattered-glass"]` table in [effect.toml](effect.toml).
The [complete configuration reference](../../README.md#configuration-reference) explains
selection, overrides, and accepted ranges. The values below are this preset's shipped
settings, including defaults for omitted keys.

| TOML setting | Shipped value | What changing it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `"animation"` | Keep this kind: the source implements its `animation` entry point. |
| `shader` | `"shader.glsl"` | Loads the source beside this preset; change the path only when using another compatible source. |
| `palette` | `false` | This source does not read the palette; enabling it alone does not recolour the effect. |

Edit the event tables in your main Umbriel configuration (the activation
example is [config.toml](config.toml)). Larger `duration_ms` gives a slower
transition. Both `[animation] enabled` and the event must be enabled.

| Event | Example duration | Example curve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[animation.windows_in]` | `900` ms | `"linear"` |
| `[animation.windows_out]` | `800` ms | `"linear"` |

Use `effect = ""` to clear the custom selection or event `enabled = false`
to disable the transition. Spring curves choose their own duration.
This shader uses linear progress: changing easing does not reshape its internal phases.
Opening/closing `style` and `scale` do not tune a working custom shader.
There is no animation-preset TOML `speed`; use event timing.

### Shader controls

Edit these values in [shader.glsl](shader.glsl), not in TOML. `#define` is
active GLSL code; comments use `//` or `/* ... */`. Start with small changes
and keep paired shaders in sync. Keep size and duration divisors positive.

| GLSL control or expression | Shipped value | Visual effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SHARD_FLIGHT` | `1.0` | Shard travel multiplier in shorter-window-side units; lower keeps shards nearer their origins. Try 0.6–1.4; the fracture topology stays fixed. |

Save and reload; see [reloading edits](../../README.md#reloading-edits).

### Additional tuning notes

Edit `SHARD_FLIGHT` in the shader to scale flight distances in shorter-window-side units; try 0.6–1.4 (default 1.0). The unequal polygon geometry is baked into the shader to avoid a per-fragment Voronoi search. Per-transition seeds vary movement, not the fracture topology. Colours are defined in the shader; this preset does not read the theme palette.

## Compatibility and cost

Targets `animation.windows_in` and `animation.windows_out` with the Umbriel preset effects API and GLSL ES 1.00. Both visible endpoints return the original premultiplied sample; both hidden endpoints return transparent black. No previous-frame feedback or extra textures are used.

Up to 41 bounded shard candidates per fragment, with early culling, up to nine half-plane distances, and a texture sample only for covering fragments. This is the most expensive effect in the set. No hardware performance benchmark is claimed.

Shards are clipped at the original window bounds. The same seed follows the exact reverse trajectory; separate events receive separate seeds. The fixed fracture topology contains unequal convex polygons rather than a triangle grid.

See the [paired-transition validation report](../../VALIDATION.md#paired-window-transitions) for tested revisions, compilation, endpoint checks, and remaining runtime limitations.
