# Wet Paint

Opening pours long, uneven paint streams down the window. Closing slowly drains the window in elongated drips, stretching its content through a broad glossy wet region.

Synthetic shader render at 55% of opening, not a compositor screenshot. Explore both directions and scrub the timeline in the [interactive preview](../../preview/).

## Use

Save [effect.toml](effect.toml) and [shader.glsl](shader.glsl) together in `~/.config/umbriel/shaders/community/animation/wet-paint/`, keeping the [MIT license](../../LICENSES/Barrulus-MIT.txt). Merge [config.toml](config.toml) into your Umbriel configuration:

```toml
[include]
files = ["shaders/community/animation/wet-paint/effect.toml"]

[animation]
enabled = true

[animation.windows_in]
enabled = true
effect = "wet-paint"
duration_ms = 1150
curve = "linear"

[animation.windows_out]
enabled = true
effect = "wet-paint"
duration_ms = 1000
curve = "linear"
```

Append the include path to an existing `files` array and merge existing tables; do not duplicate them. Including the preset registers it; the two selectors activate the opening/closing pair. Animation selection is global per event.

## Theme palette

This preset enables `palette = true` in `effect.toml`. Artwork colours follow
Umbriel's `[colors]` accents, warning, and error colours, while retaining shading
and highlights. Set `palette = false` in that preset to restore the original
colours shown in the preview. For a border with a companion overlay, change
both presets together. Shader colour constants are the fallback colours.

## Configuration options

Edit the existing `[effects.preset."wet-paint"]` table in [effect.toml](effect.toml).
The [complete configuration reference](../../README.md#configuration-reference) explains
selection, overrides, and accepted ranges. The values below are this preset's shipped
settings, including defaults for omitted keys.

| TOML setting | Shipped value | What changing it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `"animation"` | Keep this kind: the source implements its `animation` entry point. |
| `shader` | `"shader.glsl"` | Loads the source beside this preset; change the path only when using another compatible source. |
| `palette` | `true` | Use theme colours for artwork. Set false to restore the original shader colours. |

Edit the event tables in your main Umbriel configuration (the activation
example is [config.toml](config.toml)). Larger `duration_ms` gives a slower
transition. Both `[animation] enabled` and the event must be enabled.

| Event | Example duration | Example curve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[animation.windows_in]` | `1150` ms | `"linear"` |
| `[animation.windows_out]` | `1000` ms | `"linear"` |

Use `effect = ""` to clear the custom selection or event `enabled = false`
to disable the transition. Spring curves choose their own duration.
This shader uses linear progress: changing easing does not reshape its internal phases.
Opening/closing `style` and `scale` do not tune a working custom shader.
There is no animation-preset TOML `speed`; use event timing.

### Shader controls

Edit these values in [shader.glsl](shader.glsl), not in TOML. `#define` is
active GLSL code; comments use `//` or `/* ... */`. Start with small changes
and keep paired shaders in sync. Keep size and duration divisors positive.

| GLSL control or expression | Shipped value | Visual effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STREAM_WIDTH` | `58.0` | Average paint-stream width in logical pixels; larger gives fewer, wider streams. Try 35–85. |
| `DRIP_LENGTH` | `0.52` | Hanging-finger length in window-height units; lower makes shorter paint drips. |

Save and reload; see [reloading edits](../../README.md#reloading-edits).

### Additional tuning notes

Edit `STREAM_WIDTH` for average drip spacing in logical pixels; try 35–85 (default 58). `DRIP_LENGTH` controls finger length as a fraction of window height; try 0.35–0.70 (default 0.52). Artwork follows the theme palette; shader colour constants apply with `palette = false`.

## Compatibility and cost

Targets `animation.windows_in` and `animation.windows_out` with the Umbriel preset effects API and GLSL ES 1.00. Both visible endpoints return the original premultiplied sample; both hidden endpoints return transparent black. No previous-frame feedback or extra textures are used.

One texture sample, interpolated procedural noise, and a bounded three-stream search per fragment. No hardware performance benchmark is claimed.

The effect stretches captured window content into paint; it does not simulate a fluid or leave puddles outside the window.

See the [paired-transition validation report](../../VALIDATION.md#paired-window-transitions) for tested revisions, compilation, endpoint checks, and remaining runtime limitations.
