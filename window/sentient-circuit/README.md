# Sentient Circuit

Etched circuit buses, independent junctions, and light-reactive pulses.

## Use

Follow the [installation instructions](../../README.md#install), then merge this into `~/.config/umbriel/config.toml`:

```toml
[include]
files = ["shaders/community/window/sentient-circuit/effect.toml"]

[effects]
window = "window.sentient-circuit"
```

Append the include path to your existing `files` array and merge selectors into existing tables. Including `effect.toml` defines the preset; the selector enables it. [`config.toml`](config.toml) contains the same copyable example.

## Colours and tuning

Colours are defined in `shader.glsl`. Setting `palette = true` alone will not recolour a shader that does not read the palette. Edit its colour constants to customise it.

## Compatibility and cost

Requires Umbriel with the preset effects API introduced in [`512e2fb3`](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/umbriel/commit/512e2fb3). See [validation and limitations](../../VALIDATION.md). No previous-frame feedback buffers are used. This adds a pass per affected window; applying it globally increases the cost with the number and size of visible windows. The shader contains loops; performance depends on your GPU and the affected area. No performance benchmark is claimed.
